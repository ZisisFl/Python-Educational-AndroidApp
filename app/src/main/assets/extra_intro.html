	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
  <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
  <li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
  <li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
</ul>

<h2>History of Python</h2>
<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>
<p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
<p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

<h2>Python Features</h2>
Python's features include −
<ul>
  <li>Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
  <li>Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
  <li>Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
  <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
  <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
  <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
  <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
  <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
  <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
  <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −</p>
<ul>
  <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
  <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
  <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
  <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
  <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
</ul>
