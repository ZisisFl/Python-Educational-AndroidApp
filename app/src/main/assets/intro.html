<h2>About Tame the Python</h2>
	<p>Tame the Python is an easy to use mobile application with aim to bring people closer to programming. We thought that a great way to accomplish that would be creating an application that anyone 
	even with no programming background at all could use for some minutes everyday and learn to create his very own scripts in order to solve simple tasks. Also we put a lot of thought into which programming language we should use and we concluded that there is no better language than Python due to its simple yet powerful syntax.</p>
	<p>Python is really popular nowadays with many diffrent applications in web development (server-side), system scripting, software development, machine learning/data science and more. So it makes a great way to enter the world of programming being both easy and useful.</p>
